# MiXCR overview

![overview.svg](overview.svg)

MiXCR is a powerful platform for discovering T- and B-cell repertoire data. It works with any kind of sequencing data:

 - bulk data with or without UMIs
 - single cell data including but not limited to 10x Genomics protocols
 - RNA-Seq or any other kind of fragmented/shotgun data which may contain just a tiny fraction of target sequences
 - and any other kind of sequencing data containing TCRs or BCRs

Powerful downstream analysis allows to obtain vector plots and tabular results for multiple measures. Key features include:

 - grouping samples by metadata values and compare repertoire features between groups
 - comprehensive repertoire normalization and filtering
 - statistical significance tests with proper p-value adjustment
 - repertoire overlap analysis
 - novel alleles discovery
 - antibody somatic hypermutation trees with postanalysis
 - clonotype tracking
